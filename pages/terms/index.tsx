          <p className="content__p">
            These Terms constitute the entire and exclusive understanding and
            agreement between us and you regarding the Services and Content, and
            these Terms supersede and replace any and all prior oral or written
            understandings or agreements between us and you regarding the
            Services and Content. If for any reason a court of competent
            jurisdiction finds any provision of these Terms invalid or
            unenforceable, that provision will be enforced to the maximum extent
            permissible and the other provisions of these Terms will remain in
            full force and effect.
          </p>
          <p className="content__p">
            You may not assign or transfer these Terms, by operation of law or
            otherwise, without our prior written consent. Any attempt by you to
            assign or transfer these Terms, without such consent, will be null.
            We may freely assign or transfer these Terms without restriction.
            Subject to the foregoing, these Terms will bind and inure to the
            benefit of the parties, their successors and permitted assigns.
          </p>
          <p className="content__p">
            Any notices or other communications provided by us under these
            Terms, including those regarding modifications to these Terms, will
            be given: via email; or by posting to the Services. For notices made
            by e-mail, the date of receipt will be deemed the date on which such
            notice is transmitted.
          </p>
          <p className="content__p">
            Our failure to enforce any right or provision of these Terms will
            not be considered a waiver of such right or provision. The waiver of
            any such right or provision will be effective only if in writing and
            signed by our duly authorized representative. Except as expressly
            set forth in these Terms, the exercise by either party of any of its
            remedies under these Terms will be without prejudice to its other
            remedies under these Terms or otherwise.
